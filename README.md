   Finds the smallest rectangle containing the area where two satellite photos 
   taken at different times are completely identical.
 
   The input starts with the number of rows and columns in the photos (1 <= N, M <= 1000). 
   Following are N rows of pixels for the first image and another N rows for the second image. 
   Each row describes M pixels, with brightness values between 0 and 255.
 
   Outputs the column indexes of the upper left and lower right corners of the smallest 
   identical area between the two images.

  This program performs several functions, including:
  - Calculation of discounts
  - Calculation of the total price of real estate
  - Calculation of the average price per room
  - It uses a TreeSet to store different properties,
    and the information about these properties is written into a file.

```
  The class provides methods to read data from a file,
  add objects to a TreeSet, and write the TreeSet's information to another file

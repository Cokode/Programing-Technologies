* **First Week**
  > **Saterlight Image**
  > [open source code ](https://github.com/Cokode/Programing-Technologies/blob/main/src/main/java/firstWeek/SatelliteImage.java)

```

   Finds the smallest rectangle containing the area where two satellite photos 
   taken at different times are completely identical.
 
   The input starts with the number of rows and columns in the photos (1 <= N, M <= 1000). 
   Following are N rows of pixels for the first image and another N rows for the second image. 
   Each row describes M pixels, with brightness values between 0 and 255.
 
   Outputs the column indexes of the upper left and lower right corners of the smallest 
   identical area between the two images.

```

* **Second Week**
  > **Java (OOP) a program to help a real Estate (Property) Agent**
  > [open source code ](https://github.com/Cokode/Programing-Technologies/tree/main/src/main/java/secondWeek)

  This program performs several functions, including:
  - Calculation of discounts
  - Calculation of the total price of real estate
  - Calculation of the average price per room
  - It uses a TreeSet to store different properties,
    and the information about these properties is written into a file.

* **Third Week**
  > **Real Estate Project main class**
  > [open source code ](https://github.com/Cokode/Programing-Technologies/blob/main/src/main/java/thirdWeek/RealEstates.java)

```
    The class provides methods to read data from a file,
    add objects to a TreeSet, and write the TreeSet's information to another file

```

* **Fourth Week**
  > **Working with Maven, Taking input from Command Line Interface (CLI)/ Terminal**
  > [Goto src page](https://github.com/Cokode/maven-project)

```
    In this course we learnt about version control, Git, GitHub, Maven and working with dependencies, 

```

* **Fifth Week**
  > **Collection | Generics | Built in classes | Interfaces**
  > [open source code ](https://github.com/Cokode/Programing-Technologies/blob/main/src/main/java/fifthWeek/ArrayListExercises.java)

    **Problems solved concerning collections:**
  - ArrayList
  - LinkedList
  - HashSet
  - TreeSet

* **Eigth Week**
  > **Debugging | Logging | JUnit 5| Unit Testing**
  > [open source code ](https://github.com/Cokode/Programing-Technologies/blob/main/src/main/java/fifthWeek/ArrayListExercises.java)
